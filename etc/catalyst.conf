# source_matching specifies how catalyst will match non-specific file names

#
# possible values are:
#   "strict" meaning if more than one file of that name is present with any
#            file extension, then it will raise an exception.
#   "loose"  meaning it will search for an existing filename with an added
#            extension from an ordered list of extensions determined from the
#            decompressor_search_order specification in the spec file or (default)

# var_tmpfs_portage will mount a tmpfs for /var/tmp/portage so building takes place in RAM
